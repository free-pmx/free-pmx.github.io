List of posts
-------------

-  | `Proxmox VE Live System build <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/live-build/>`__ - *Created 14 Mar 2025* - *Updated 14 Mar 2025*
   | Build a live system that boots the same kernel and provides necessary compatible tooling as a regular install - with a compact footprint. Use it as a rescue system, custom installer springboard and much more - including running full PVE node disk-less.

-  | `Fragile Proxmox cluster management <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/insights/cluster-fragile/>`__ - *Created 28 Feb 2025* - *Updated 28 Feb 2025*
   | Proxmox Cluster filesystem builds on Corosync, but there are oddities in the PVE configuration. The support for cluster management is imperfect and can bring inexplicable situations which deserve a better user approach.

-  | `SSH certificates setup <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/ssh-certs/>`__ - *Created 15 Feb 2025* - *Updated 15 Feb 2025*
   | PKI SSH setups for complex clusters or virtual guests should be a norm, one which improves security, but also manageability. With a scripted setup, automated key rotations come as a bonus.

-  | `Public Key Infrastructure with Secure Shell <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/insights/ssh-pki/>`__ - *Created 09 Feb 2025* - *Updated 09 Feb 2025*
   | Secure your SSH infrastructure from the very first boot. Rotate keys and never trust a previously unknown machine. Never pass through a key-not-known prompt and do not get used to the identification-changed warning with a remote host.

-  | `ERROR: dpkg processing archive during apt install <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/error-dpkg-conflict/>`__ - *Created 31 Jan 2025* - *Updated 31 Jan 2025*
   | Conflicts in files as packaged by Proxmox and what finds its way into underlying Debian install do arise. Pass proper options to the apt command for remedy.

-  | `Verbose boot with GRUB <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/grub-verbose/>`__ - *Created 08 Oct 2024* - *Updated 25 Jan 2025*
   | Most PVE boots are entirely quiet. Avoid issues with troubleshooting non-booting system later by setting verbose boots. If you are already in trouble, there is a remedy as well.

-  | `ZFSBootMenu setup for Proxmox VE <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/zfs-boot/>`__ - *Created 20 Jan 2025* - *Updated 24 Jan 2025*
   | A complete feature-set bootloader for ZFS on root install. It allows booting off multiple datasets, selecting kernels, creating snapshots and clones, rollbacks and much more - as much as a rescue system would.

-  | `Taking advantage of ZFS on root <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/insights/zfs-root/>`__ - *Created 20 Jan 2025* - *Updated 24 Jan 2025*
   | A look at limited support of ZFS by Proxmox VE stock install. A primer on ZFS basics insofar ZFS as a root filesystem setups - snapshots and clones, with examples. Preparation for ZFS bootloader install with offline backups all-in-one guide.

-  | `Passwordless SSH can lock you out <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/insights/ssh-lockout/>`__ - *Created 23 Sep 2024* - *Updated 21 Jan 2025*
   | Not so intuitive cascade of events may lead to inability to SSH connect to a node with otherwise healthy networking setup due to inaccessible keys location.

-  | `Restore entire host from backup <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/host-restore/>`__ - *Created 10 Jan 2025* - *Updated 10 Jan 2025*
   | Restore a full root filesystem of a backed up Proxmox node - use case with ZFS as an example, but can be appropriately adjusted for other systems. Approach without obscure tools. Simple tar, sgdisk and chroot. A follow-up to the previous post on backing up the entire root filesystem offline from a rescue boot.

-  | `Rescue or backup entire host <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/host-backup/>`__ - *Created 06 Jan 2025* - *Updated 06 Jan 2025*
   | Access PVE host root filesystem when booting off Proxmox installer ISO. A non-intuitive case of ZFS install not supported by regular Live Debian. Fast full host backup (no guests) demonstration resulting in 1G archive that is sent out over SSH. This will allow for flexible redeployment in a follow-up guide. No proprietary products involved, just regular Debian tooling.

-  | `Why Proxmox VE shreds your SSDs <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/insights/pve-ssds/>`__ - *Created 03 Nov 2024* - *Updated 02 Jan 2025*

-  | `The ‘no-subscription’ repository <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/insights/pve-repos/>`__ - *Created 26 Dec 2024* - *Updated 28 Dec 2024*
   | What exactly do you get from the non-subscriber and freely available package repository? And what are the differences to the one meant for public testing only. Almost none.

-  | `Upgrades and repositories <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/apt-update/>`__ - *Created 24 Dec 2024* - *Updated 24 Dec 2024*

-  | `DHCP setup of a single node <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/dhcp-single/>`__ - *Created 28 Sep 2024* - *Updated 14 Dec 2024*
   | Set up your sole node Proxmox VE install as any other server - with DHCP assigned IP address. Useful when IPs are managed as static reservations or dynamic environments. No pesky scripting involved.

-  | `Proxmox VE nag removal, scripted <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/pve-nag-script/>`__ - *Created 13 Dec 2024* - *Updated 13 Dec 2024*
   | Automate subscription notice suppression to avoid the need for manual intervention during periods of active UI development. No risky scripts with obscure regular expressions that might corrupt the system in the future.

-  | `The pmxcfs mountpoint of /etc/pve <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/insights/pmxcfs-mount/>`__ - *Created 08 Dec 2024* - *Updated 08 Dec 2024*
   | Understand the setup of virtual filesystem that holds cluster-wide configurations and has a not-so-usual behaviour - unlike any other regular filesystem.

-  | `The Proxmox Corosync fallacy <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/insights/corosync-fallacy/>`__ - *Created 16 Nov 2024* - *Updated 08 Dec 2024*
   | Distinguish the role of Corosync in Proxmox clusters from the rest of the stack and appreciate the actual reasons behind unexpected reboots or failed quorums.

-  | `Some lesser known quorum options <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/insights/quorum-options/>`__ - *Created 01 Dec 2024* - *Updated 01 Dec 2024*
   | When considering a Quorum Device for small clusters, be aware of other valid alternatives that were taken off the list only due to High Availability stack concerns.

-  | `The Proxmox cluster filesystem build <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/pmxcfs-build/>`__ - *Created 30 Nov 2024* - *Updated 30 Nov 2024*

-  | `The Proxmox cluster probe <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/cluster-probe/>`__ - *Created 29 Nov 2024* - *Updated 29 Nov 2024*
   | Experimental setup that can in fact serve as a probe to the health of a cluster. Unlike e.g. Quorum Device, it mimics an actual full fledged node without the hardware or architecture requirements.

-  | `WARNING: Setting locale failed <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/warning-locale/>`__ - *Created 27 Nov 2024* - *Updated 27 Nov 2024*
   | Common Perl warning during upgrades regarding locale settings lies in AcceptEnv directive of SSH config. A better default for any Proxmox VE install, or any Debian-based server in fact.

   | Brief look at what exactly brings up the dreaded notice regarding no valid subscription. Eliminate bad UX that no user of free software should need to endure.

-  | `ERROR: failed to load local private key <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/error-pve-ssl-key/>`__ - *Created 10 Oct 2024* - *Updated 22 Nov 2024*
   | Misleading error message during failed boot-up of a cluster node that can send you chasing a red herring. Recognise it and rectify the actual underlying issue.

-  | `Extract Cluster configuration - /etc/pve <https://free-pmx.pages.dev/guides/configs-extract/>`__ - *Created 03 Oct 2024* - *Updated 02 Nov 2024*
   | Recover individual cluster configuration without need for a bogus node. Both from previous backup or a corrupt database. The source does not need to originate from the same cluster.
